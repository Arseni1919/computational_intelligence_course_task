# Kind of Problems That This Simulator Solves

We consider the capacitated facility location problem 
with hard capacities. We are given a set of facilities, 
F, and a set of clients D in a common metric space. 
Each facility i has a facility opening cost f<sub>i</sub> and 
capacity u<sub>i</sub> that specifies the maximum number of 
clients that may be assigned to this facility. We want
 to open some facilities from the set F and assign 
 each client to an open facility so that at most ui 
 clients are assigned to any open facility i. 
 The cost of assigning client j to facility i is 
 given by their distance c<sub>ij</sub> , and our goal is to 
 minimize the sum of the facility opening costs and 
 the client assignment costs.
